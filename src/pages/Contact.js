        <p>
          A smile? Always, unless we are out of coffee ðŸ˜„ I had been working in
          Accounting and Auditing, but I have recently decided to make a career
          change and take a new step in my professional career. I am currently
          living in and in love with MÃ¡laga, where I am studying a Full Stack
          Web Development Bootcamp (Dec 2021).
